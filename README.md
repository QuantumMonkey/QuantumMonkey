- 👋 Hi, I’m Anand.
- 👀 I’m interested in making a sentient AI to be a friend and a teacher. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code again. Unlearning my mistakes and erronous techniques is a major step towards excellence. Wondering why I say this? A helpful person, and hopefully a friend by the time you read this, told me that going open source with my journey would make me accountable and that is truly necessary at this point.
-     Hopefully this will be more optimistic one day!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything AI!
- 📫 Welcome, come say hi!
